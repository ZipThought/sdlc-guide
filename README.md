## Introduction

This repository contains comprehensive documentation and resources for our OKR-based software development methodology. It is designed to help teams align their efforts, set ambitious goals, and track progress effectively throughout the development process.

Our approach is based on the following principles:
- Ambitious goal-setting
- Measurable outcomes
- Regular review and adaptation
- Transparency and alignment across all levels of the organization

## Repository Structure

- `docs/`: Core documentation of our SDLC process
- `templates/`: Reusable templates for OKRs, ADRs, and project timelines
- `tools/`: Useful tools and scripts for implementing the SDLC process
- `resources/`: Additional reading materials and external links

## Key Documents

Here are the main documents that form the core of our SDLC guide:

1. [Introduction to OKR-Based SDLC](docs/introduction.md)
2. [Timeframes and Milestones](docs/timeframes-and-milestones.md)
3. [Why OKRs](docs/why-okr.md)
4. [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Getting Started

1. Start by reading the [Introduction to OKR-Based SDLC](docs/introduction.md) for an overview of our methodology.
2. Review the [Timeframes and Milestones](docs/timeframes-and-milestones.md) document to understand how we structure our development cycles.
3. Dive deeper into the concept of OKRs by reading [Why OKRs](docs/why-okr.md).
4. If you're planning to contribute to this guide or any projects using this methodology, please read our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Contributing

We encourage all team members to contribute to this guide. Whether you've found a typo, want to improve an explanation, or have a new best practice to share, your input is valuable.

Please read the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to contribute to this repository.

## Referencing Guide

This project use IEEE referencing style [[1]](#references). When referencing external sources or citing research in our documentation:

1. Use inline citations with a number in square brackets, e.g., [1].
2. Include a "References" section at the end of the document.
3. List references in order of appearance, using a consistent format:
   - For academic papers: Author(s), "Title," Journal, vol., no., pp., year, DOI (if available).
   - For books: Author(s), "Title," Edition (if not first), Publisher, Year.
   - For websites: Author(s) (if available), "Page Title," Website Name, URL (accessed date).
4. When possible, include DOIs or stable URLs for online resources.
