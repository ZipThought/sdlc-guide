## Introduction

This repository contains comprehensive documentation and resources for our OKR-based software development methodology. It is designed to help teams align their efforts, set ambitious goals, and track progress effectively throughout the development process.

Our approach is based on the following principles:
- Ambitious goal-setting
- Measurable outcomes
- Regular review and adaptation
- Transparency and alignment across all levels of the organization

## Repository Structure

- `docs/`: Core documentation of our SDLC process
- `templates/`: Reusable templates for OKRs, ADRs, and project timelines
- `tools/`: Useful tools and scripts for implementing the SDLC process
- `resources/`: Additional reading materials and external links

## Key Documents

Here are the main documents that form the core of our SDLC guide:

1. [Introduction to OKR-Based SDLC](docs/introduction.md)
2. [Timeframes and Milestones](docs/timeframes-and-milestones.md)
