## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our Code of Conduct. Please report unacceptable behavior to [coc@zipthought.com.au].

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Create a new branch for your contribution.

## How to Contribute

1. **Reporting Bugs**: Open an issue in the repository, using the bug report template if available.
2. **Suggesting Enhancements**: Open an issue in the repository, using the feature request template if available.
3. **Code Contributions**: Submit a pull request with your changes.
4. **Documentation Improvements**: Submit a pull request with your changes to the relevant markdown files.

## Style Guide

- Use clear, concise language (nobody, including LLM is willing to read too much).
- Follow markdown best practices (hint: our LLM will really glad we use md).
- Use American English spelling (yes! we're in Melbourne but software is global).
- Use sentence case for headings (it is prettier that way).

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code adheres to the style guide. The best way to do so is actually to ask your trusted LLM to check your diff against this contribution guide.
2. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you. The preferred merge is [Squash and merge](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-commits).

## Feedback and Discussions

We encourage open discussion on all aspects of this SDLC guide. You can use Issues for that.

Thank you for contributing to our SDLC Guide!
